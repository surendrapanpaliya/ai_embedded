Artificial Intelligence for Embedded System

Learning Outcomes:
•	Understand the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning for embedded systems.
•	Gain hands-on experience in building and deploying ML models on embedded devices.
•	Learn how to optimize AI models for power efficiency and real-time inference on resource-constrained hardware.
•	Integrate OpenAI APIs into embedded applications for advanced AI capabilities.

Prerequisites
•	Basic knowledge of embedded systems and microcontrollers
•	Familiarity with Python programming
•	Basic understanding of C/C++
•	Understanding of fundamental AI and machine learning concepts
•	Knowledge of electronics and hardware interfaces

Lab Setup Requirements
•	A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
•	Python 3.x installed
•	Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
•	IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)
•	Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow Lite, Edge Impulse
•	Internet connection for accessing online datasets and documentation

Step-by-Step Lab Setup Using Google Colab

1.	Open Google Colab:
o	Go to Google Colab and open a new notebook.
o	https://colab.research.google.com/notebook

2.	Install Required Libraries: Google Colab comes with many pre-installed libraries, but you'll need to install some additional ones. You can install libraries such as TensorFlow Lite and Edge Impulse using the following commands:
# Install TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite dependencies
!pip install tensorflow
# Install required libraries for data science and machine learning
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
# Edge Impulse dependencies (if needed)
# Edge Impulse isn't directly installable via pip, but the SDK can be installed for development purposes
!pip install edge-impulse-linux

3.	Connect Google Colab to Google Drive: If you want to store your datasets or access files directly from Google Drive, you can connect it to your Colab notebook:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
4.	Working with Jupyter Notebook-like Interface: Google Colab is essentially a hosted Jupyter environment, so you can write Python code, run cells, and visualize data with libraries like matplotlib, pandas, etc.
